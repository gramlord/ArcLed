The ArcLed library allows you to easily flash and blink leds.

There are many libraries around that let you do this, but none are this easy.
Take the minimal, do-nothing Arduino sketch, add 6 lines of code, and you have
a led that's flashing. And not just flashing on and off with set timing,
flashing with up to 6 different on/off timings.  

So what can you really do with those 6 lines? You can turn a led on. You can
turn it off. You can make it flash for a number of milli seconds. You can make
it flash with a number of on-ms and off-ms repeatedly. You can make if flash
repeatedly 4 times on and off with different ms intervals, and you can make it
flash on and off repeatedly 6 times with different ms intervales. All with
those same 6 lines.

And you can have multiple instances of ArcLed, blinking and flashing
multiple leds at the same time.
